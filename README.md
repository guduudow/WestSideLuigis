# About The Project
This project was a collaborative effort that merged the features of 3 different projects to make WestSideLuigis! All features recieved full CRUD functionality which included a Beer and Brewery list, receptions and attendees, as well as menu items, food categories and orders. We decided that with our features combined we could create a restaurant website using ASP.NET with MVC and Viewmodels. WestSideLuigis also has login and role authentication which prevents non admin users from creating, updating or deleting any entries from the mentioned feature list. An extra feature seen in this project is the ability to upload images for beers and breweries. By default if there is no image uploaded it will remain as a generic image for all entries, however once updated with an image of the users choosing it will be visible.
